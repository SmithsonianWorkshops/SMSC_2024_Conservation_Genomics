Workshop data are in ```/data/genomics/workshops/smsc_2024/```

We will be using a few data sources to learn how to use many different software packages for conservation genomics:
  - PacBio, Hi-C data, and Illumina from a Guam rail (_Hypotaenidia owstoni_)
  - Illumina short-read data from 3 Guam Rail individuals (all Guam rail (_Hypotaenidia owstoni_).
